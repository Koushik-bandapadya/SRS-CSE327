      <p style="text-align:left">
          Because To-let is a web base system itâ€™s Operating environment is independent but we also make To-let
           for android user, so it need java for running the app.
         </p>

    <h5 style="text-align:left"><ul><li><strong>2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints </strong></li></ul></h5>
    <br>
          <p style="text-align:left">
    1.Admin needs to check and update the database for new houses detail list by manually or by the help of integrated API.<br>
2.Users devices having the system (Website/app) must be connected via WIFI or Mobile Data.<br>
3.Users devices must have a GPS system in built. (For android phones for searching in Argument Reality, user devices must have gyroscope, AI functionality).<br>
4.User devices should have sufficient memories.<br>
5.Users must search within Dhaka region to avoid uncertain issues, because for now it will work only in this region.
</p>
